# Customized Vault Analyzer

Forked from the absolutely-wonderful Vault Analyzer by TMMania.\
I only use the "End-Game" queries, so the other versions aren't included.\
Makes the following adjustments based on my personal playstyle:

1. Does not exclude exotics that you have duplicates of.
    - Reason: If I have multiples of the same exotic then I want to know if one of them doesn't match the criteria.

2. Does not exclude masterworked armor or armor that is max power/pinnacle cap.
    - Reason: Just because a particular piece is masterworked or dropped at max power doesn't mean that it's worth using. If a masterworked piece doesn't meet the criteria then I want to dismantle it to use the materials to masterwork a better piece.
